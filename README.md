Here’s a simple way to do it using Python’s built-in HTTP server:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the website directory in the project where the `index.html` file is located.
3. Run the following command: python -m http.server
If you’re using Python 3, use: python3 -m http.server
4. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8000. You should see your `index.html` file.
5. Use the UI in your browser to run the allocation calculator.

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. This method uses Python’s HTTP server to serve files locally. If you have another preferred method or tool for serving files, feel free to use that.

Choose the method that suits your preferences and development environment.
